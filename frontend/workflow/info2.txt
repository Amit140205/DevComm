// 4. working on sidebar

// 5. most important => for global state management we are going to use "zustand"
kind of similar to context-api and redux toolkit usage wise
=> making a new custom hook useThemeSelector()

// 6. start implementing home page

// 7. notifications page

// 8. chat page
**** set up stream
